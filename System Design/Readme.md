#### Day 4: Database Design
- **Relational vs. NoSQL Databases**
  - Learn the differences between relational and NoSQL databases.
- **Database Normalization and Denormalization**
  - Understand normalization for reducing redundancy and denormalization for performance.
- **Database Sharding and Partitioning**
  - Explore techniques for distributing data across multiple servers.

#### Day 5: Caching Strategies
- **Importance of Caching**
  - Learn why caching is critical for performance.
- **Types of Caching (Client-side, Server-side, CDN)**
  - Understand different caching types and their use cases.
- **Cache Invalidation Strategies**
  - Explore strategies for keeping cache data consistent with the source of truth.

#### Day 6: Load Balancing
- **Concepts of Load Balancing**
  - Understand the role of load balancers in distributing traffic.
- **Types of Load Balancers (Hardware vs. Software)**
  - Compare hardware and software load balancers.
- **Load Balancing Algorithms**
  - Learn common algorithms like round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.

#### Day 7: Data Consistency and Availability
- **CAP Theorem**
  - Explore the CAP theorem and its implications for system design.
- **Trade-offs Between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance**
  - Understand the trade-offs and how to make decisions based on requirements.
- **Implementing Data Replication**
  - Learn techniques for replicating data to ensure availability and consistency.

#### Day 8: Designing for Failure
- **Fault Tolerance and High Availability**
  - Understand strategies for building fault-tolerant and highly available systems.
- **Designing Redundant Systems**
  - Explore redundancy at different levels (hardware, software, network).
- **Handling Network Partitions and Failures**
  - Learn how to design systems that can handle network partitions gracefully.

#### Day 9: Security Considerations
- **Basic Security Principles**
  - Learn about confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad).
- **Common Security Threats and Mitigation Strategies**
  - Understand common threats like SQL injection, XSS, and how to mitigate them.
- **Implementing Secure Authentication and Authorization**
  - Explore techniques for secure authentication (e.g., OAuth, JWT) and authorization.

#### Day 10: Case Studies and Examples
- **Real-world System Design Examples**
  - Analyze successful system designs from industry leaders.
- **Analyzing Successful System Architectures**
  - Break down what makes these architectures effective.
- **Lessons Learned from System Failures**
