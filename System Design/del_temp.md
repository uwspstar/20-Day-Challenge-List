### Description:
1. **Shared**: Contains `DataModels` and `Service Requests/Responses` shared by both the client and server.
2. **Client**: Includes the Blazor WASM stack (`Razor Components`, `.NET`, and `WebAssembly`) and interacts with `ViewModels`, `Client Services`, `Service Agents`, and `Local Storage`.
3. **Server**: Handles `Web APIs`, `Server Services`, `Data Access` layers, and communicates with the `CTABS` database through `Entity Framework Core`.
4. Arrows indicate interactions and dependencies between components.

Here's the corresponding **mermaid sequence diagram** based on the architecture:

    participant Shared as Shared Models
    participant Server as Server (Web APIs)
    participant Services as Server Services
    participant DataAccess as Data Access
    participant Database as CTABS (Database)

    Client->>ViewModels: User interaction triggers event
    ViewModels->>Shared: Access DataModels/Service Requests
    ViewModels->>Client: Update UI
    Client->>Server: Send API request via Service Agents
    Server->>Shared: Use Service Requests/Responses
    Server->>Services: Process business logic
    Services->>DataAccess: Access data repository
    DataAccess->>Database: Query or update database
    Database-->>DataAccess: Return data
    DataAccess-->>Services: Pass data back
    Services-->>Server: Return processed response
    Server-->>Client: Send API response
    Client->>ViewModels: Update UI with response data
```

### Key Flow:
1. **Client Interaction**: The user interacts with the Blazor WASM frontend, triggering events handled by `ViewModels`.
2. **Data Handling**: The `ViewModels` may use shared models (`DataModels` or `Service Requests`) for preparing requests or updating the UI.
3. **API Communication**: The `Client` sends an API request to the `Server` through `Service Agents`.
4. **Server Processing**: The server processes the request using shared models, server services, and the data access layer.
5. **Database Interaction**: The `Data Access` layer interacts with the `CTABS` database via `Entity Framework Core`.
6. **Response Back to Client**: The response data flows back through the server, updating the client UI.

This sequence diagram visually represents the interaction flow between the components based on the architecture.

From this architecture diagram, the following content can be extracted:

### Shared
- **DataModels**: Models shared between the client and server.
- **Service Requests/Responses**: Definitions for service requests and responses.

---

### Client (.NET 6)
- **Blazor WASM** (WebAssembly):
  - **Razor Components (Views)**: Frontend view components.
  - **.NET**: Runs on the .NET framework.
  - **WebAssembly**: Enables cross-platform execution.
- **ViewModels**: Data models associated with client-side views.
- **Client Services**: Provides client-side service functionality.
- **Service Agents**: Proxy services to communicate with the server.
- **Local Storage**: Local storage solutions on the client side.

---

### Server (.NET 6)
- **Web APIs**: Provides service interfaces.
- **Server Services**: Implements server-side business logic.
- **Data Access**: The data access layer, which includes:
  - **Unit Of Work**: Manages transactions.
  - **Data Repository**: Data repository for operations.
  - **Entity Framework Core**: Framework for database interactions.
- **CTABS**: The backend database system.

This diagram illustrates a frontend-backend separation architecture based on Blazor WASM (WebAssembly) and .NET 6. The client interacts with the server through `ViewModels`, while the server accesses the database using Entity Framework Core and employs shared models for consistent requests and responses.
