### **Critical Questions for the Team**

#### **1. API Development**
1. What specific data fields need to be included in the API design to ensure seamless integration between CTABS and Salesforce?
2. What scalability requirements should the API meet to handle future growth in claim volume or adjuster data?
3. How will secure authentication and authorization mechanisms be implemented to ensure compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA)?

#### **2. Claims Data Integration**
4. What are the critical claim attributes (e.g., type, location, urgency) required for ingestion, and how are they validated during data transfer?
5. How will real-time synchronization be achieved between CTABS and Salesforce? Are there specific tools or protocols to ensure consistency and accuracy?
6. What are the fallback mechanisms in case of data ingestion or synchronization failures?

#### **3. Adjuster Allocation Logic**
7. What predefined criteria (e.g., expertise, location, availability) will the matching algorithm use, and how can these be customized if requirements change?
8. How will exceptions or manual overrides be managed within the workflow? Will additional approval layers or notifications be required?
9. What measures are in place to handle conflicts, such as multiple adjusters qualifying for the same claim?

#### **4. Testing and Quality Assurance**
10. What are the key scenarios and test cases for validating the API and adjuster matching logic?
11. How will the testing process simulate real-world scenarios to ensure reliability and performance in a live environment?
12. Who will be responsible for overseeing and approving the quality assurance process? Are there specific benchmarks or KPIs?

#### **5. Documentation**
13. What level of detail is required in the technical documentation to ensure proper use and maintenance of the API?
14. How will the user guide address stakeholder needs, including claim managers and adjusters, for understanding the system?
15. What format will be used for documentation, and how will updates be managed over time?

#### **6. Deployment and Support**
16. How will the deployment process be coordinated with the Kare/Sightline team to minimize disruption to ongoing operations?
17. What is the defined support period post-deployment, and what specific issues will be covered during this phase?
18. What mechanisms are in place to monitor system performance and address critical issues after deployment?

#### **General and Cross-Cutting Questions**
19. What is the resolution to the contradiction between Section 2.2 ("Current Int. Not Replaced") and Section 1.2? Does this impact the scope of work?
20. For claims data integration, what does "Are they maintained?" refer to? Are there specific responsibilities or tools needed for ongoing data maintenance?
21. On deployment, what does the annotation "What is this?" imply? Are there unclear or missing details about deployment steps or coordination efforts?
22. Are there any additional compliance requirements or regulatory considerations not yet addressed in the deliverables?
23. What KPIs or success metrics will be tracked to evaluate the effectiveness of the overall integration?
