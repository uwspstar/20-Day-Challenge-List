- **When is System Design Essential?**
  **English:** System design is crucial during the initial planning phase and whenever scalability or performance becomes a bottleneck.  
  **Chinese:** 系统设计在初期规划阶段以及当扩展性或性能成为瓶颈时尤为重要。

- **Where is System Design Applied?**
  **English:** It is applied in every large-scale system, from web applications to distributed systems, cloud platforms, and beyond.  
  **Chinese:** 系统设计适用于所有大规模系统，包括Web应用程序、分布式系统、云平台等。

#### 2. **Comparison（比较）**

| **Aspect**          | **Good System Design**                    | **Poor System Design**               |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**      | Easily scales with increased load         | Struggles to handle increased traffic |
| **Performance**      | Efficient resource utilization            | High latency or resource waste       |
| **Maintenance**      | Modular and maintainable codebase         | Hard to update or modify             |
| **Reliability**      | Handles failures gracefully               | Frequent downtimes                   |
| **Cost**             | Cost-effective scaling                    | Expensive to scale                   |

#### 3. **Tips (技巧)**

- **Plan for Growth:**  
  **English:** Always design systems with future scalability in mind to avoid rework later.  
  **Chinese:** 始终以未来的可扩展性为设计目标，以避免后期返工。

- **Use Redundancy:**  
  **English:** Incorporate redundancy in critical components to enhance fault tolerance and availability.  
  **Chinese:** 在关键组件中引入冗余，以提高容错能力和可用性。

- **Modular Design:**  
  **English:** Use modular architecture to simplify system maintenance and scalability.  
  **Chinese:** 采用模块化设计，简化系统的维护和扩展。

#### 4. **Warnings (警告)**

- **Avoid Over-engineering:**  
  **English:** Overly complex designs can lead to inefficiency and maintenance difficulties. Keep it simple.  
  **Chinese:** 过度设计可能导致效率低下和维护困难。保持简单设计。

- **Neglecting Security:**  
  **English:** Focusing solely on scalability without considering security risks can expose the system to vulnerabilities.  
  **Chinese:** 只关注可扩展性而忽视安全风险，可能会使系统面临漏洞。

#### 5. **Interview Questions（面试问题）**

1. **Why is system design important in large-scale applications?**
   - **English Answer:** It helps ensure scalability, maintainability, and reliability, allowing systems to handle increasing loads and complexity.
   - **Chinese Answer:** 它有助于确保系统的可扩展性、可维护性和可靠性，使系统能够处理日益增长的负载和复杂性。

2. **What are the key principles to follow in system design?**
   - **English Answer:** Scalability, fault tolerance, modularity, and security are the key principles to ensure efficient and sustainable systems.
   - **Chinese Answer:** 可扩展性、容错性、模块化和安全性是确保高效且可持续系统的关键原则。

3. **How do you ensure that a system can scale as traffic grows?**
   - **English Answer:** By designing for horizontal scaling, load balancing, and using distributed systems.
   - **Chinese Answer:** 通过设计水平扩展、负载均衡和使用分布式系统来确保系统可随流量增长扩展。

4. **What is the difference between functional and non-functional requirements in system design?**
   - **English Answer:** Functional requirements define what a system should do, while non-functional requirements focus on how the system performs.
   - **Chinese Answer:** 功能需求定义了系统应该做什么，而非功能需求则侧重于系统如何执行。

5. **What is the CAP theorem, and why is it important in system design?**
   - **English Answer:** CAP theorem states that a distributed system can only provide two of the following: consistency, availability, or partition tolerance. It's crucial in making trade-offs in system design.
   - **Chinese Answer:** CAP定理指出，分布式系统只能在一致性、可用性和分区容忍性中选择两者。这在系统设计中做出权衡时至关重要。

#### 6. **Summary（总结）**

- **English:** The importance of system design lies in its ability to ensure scalability, reliability, and maintainability of a system. A well-designed system is cost-effective, easier to maintain, and can gracefully handle future growth and potential failures.  
- **Chinese:** 系统设计的重要性在于它能够确保系统的可扩展性、可靠性和可维护性。一个设计良好的系统具有成本效益，易于维护，并能够优雅地处理未来的增长和潜在的故障。
