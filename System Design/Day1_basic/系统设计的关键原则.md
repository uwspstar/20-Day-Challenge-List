#### 2. **Comparison（比较）**

| **Principle**        | **Modular Design**                          | **Monolithic Design**                      |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Modularity**        | Breaks system into independent components   | Entire system is tightly coupled          |
| **Abstraction**       | Simplifies complex systems into smaller parts | Deals with the system as a whole          |
| **Separation of Concerns** | Each module focuses on a specific functionality | All functions are intertwined             |
| **Maintainability**   | Easy to modify, update, and extend          | Difficult to maintain and upgrade         |
| **Scalability**       | Easily scalable by adding new modules       | Hard to scale without redesigning         |

#### 3. **Tips (技巧)**

- **Start with Modularity:**  
  **English:** Break down the system into smaller, independent modules to ensure easy updates and scalability.  
  **Chinese:** 将系统分解为更小的独立模块，以确保易于更新和扩展。

- **Use Abstraction Wisely:**  
  **English:** Hide unnecessary complexity and present a clear interface for each component to reduce the cognitive load.  
  **Chinese:** 明智地使用抽象，隐藏不必要的复杂性，为每个组件提供清晰的接口，减轻认知负担。

- **Separate Concerns:**  
  **English:** Ensure each module has a single responsibility, making the system easier to understand, maintain, and troubleshoot.  
  **Chinese:** 确保每个模块具有单一责任，使系统更易于理解、维护和故障排除。

#### 4. **Warnings (警告)**

- **Over-Abstracting:**  
  **English:** Avoid over-complicating the design with too many layers of abstraction, which can make the system harder to manage.  
  **Chinese:** 避免使用过多的抽象层次，这可能会使系统变得难以管理。

- **Poor Separation of Concerns:**  
  **English:** Mixing functionalities in the same module makes the system difficult to maintain and troubleshoot.  
  **Chinese:** 将功能混合在同一模块中会使系统难以维护和排除故障。

#### 5. **Interview Questions（面试问题）**

1. **What is modularity, and why is it important in system design?**  
   - **English Answer:** Modularity breaks the system into independent components, allowing easy updates, testing, and scalability.  
   - **Chinese Answer:** 模块化将系统分解为独立的组件，使其易于更新、测试和扩展。

2. **How does abstraction help in system design?**  
   - **English Answer:** Abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and focusing on the essential functionality.  
   - **Chinese Answer:** 抽象通过隐藏不必要的细节并专注于基本功能，简化了复杂系统。

3. **Can you explain the concept of separation of concerns?**  
   - **English Answer:** Separation of concerns ensures each part of the system focuses on a single responsibility, improving maintainability and clarity.  
   - **Chinese Answer:** 关注点分离确保系统的每个部分都专注于单一责任，从而提高了可维护性和清晰度。

4. **How would you ensure scalability using modular design?**  
   - **English Answer:** By designing each module to be independent, you can easily scale the system by adding more modules without affecting others.  
   - **Chinese Answer:** 通过设计独立的模块，可以通过添加更多模块来轻松扩展系统，而不会影响其他部分。

5. **What are the potential downsides of over-abstraction in system design?**  
   - **English Answer:** Over-abstraction can lead to unnecessary complexity, making the system harder to understand and maintain.  
   - **Chinese Answer:** 过度抽象可能导致不必要的复杂性，使系统难以理解和维护。

#### 6. **Summary（总结）**

- **English:** The key principles of system design—modularity, abstraction, and separation of concerns—are essential for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems. Modularity helps in breaking down the system, abstraction simplifies complexity, and separation of concerns ensures each part has a single focus. Applying these principles correctly results in a system that is easier to manage, scale, and evolve.  
- **Chinese:** 系统设计的关键原则——模块化、抽象和关注点分离——对于构建可扩展、可维护和高效的系统至关重要。模块化有助于将系统分解，抽象简化了复杂性，而关注点分离确保每个部分都有单一的关注点。正确应用这些原则可以使系统更易于管理、扩展和进化。
