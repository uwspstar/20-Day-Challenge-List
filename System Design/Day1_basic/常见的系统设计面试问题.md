- **When Do These Questions Appear?**  
  **English:** System design questions are commonly asked in the final stages of technical interviews, particularly for senior-level roles.  
  **Chinese:** 系统设计问题通常出现在技术面试的最后阶段，尤其是针对高级职位。

- **Where Do These Questions Focus?**  
  **English:** These questions focus on your ability to design scalable systems that can handle real-world challenges, including load balancing, data storage, and fault tolerance.  
  **Chinese:** 这些问题侧重于你设计可扩展系统的能力，包括负载均衡、数据存储和容错等现实挑战。

#### 2. **Comparison（比较）**

| **Aspect**              | **Good Answer**                                      | **Poor Answer**                                  |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Scalability**          | Provides clear strategy for scaling (e.g., sharding, load balancing) | Ignores scaling or gives a vague solution       |
| **Performance**          | Considers trade-offs between performance and cost   | Over-focuses on performance without considering cost or complexity |
| **Data Management**      | Describes data storage and replication strategies   | Lacks detail on how data will be managed        |
| **Fault Tolerance**      | Provides redundancy and backup strategies           | Fails to consider system failures               |
| **Security**             | Includes authentication and authorization mechanisms | Omits security considerations                   |

#### 3. **Tips (技巧)**

- **Break It Down:**  
  **English:** Start by breaking the problem into smaller, manageable components (e.g., data flow, user interaction, scalability).  
  **Chinese:** 从将问题分解为较小的可管理组件开始（例如，数据流、用户交互、可扩展性）。

- **Address Trade-offs:**  
  **English:** Discuss trade-offs between different approaches, such as performance vs. cost, complexity vs. maintainability.  
  **Chinese:** 讨论不同方法之间的权衡，例如性能与成本、复杂性与可维护性之间的平衡。

- **Communicate Clearly:**  
  **English:** Explain your design decisions clearly, and justify why you chose certain technologies or patterns.  
  **Chinese:** 清晰地解释你的设计决策，并说明你为何选择某些技术或模式。

#### 4. **Warnings (警告)**

- **Ignoring Constraints:**  
  **English:** Avoid designing systems without considering real-world constraints such as cost, network latency, and data consistency.  
  **Chinese:** 避免在没有考虑现实世界约束（如成本、网络延迟和数据一致性）的情况下设计系统。

- **Overcomplicating Solutions:**  
  **English:** Don’t over-engineer your solution with unnecessary complexity. Stick to simplicity where possible.  
  **Chinese:** 不要通过不必要的复杂性过度设计你的解决方案，尽可能保持简单。

#### 5. **Interview Questions（面试问题）**

1. **Design a URL shortening service like TinyURL.**  
   - **English Answer:** Discuss how you would generate unique IDs, handle high traffic, and store mappings between shortened URLs and original URLs.  
   - **Chinese Answer:** 讨论如何生成唯一ID、处理高流量以及存储短网址与原始网址之间的映射。

2. **How would you design a distributed messaging system like Kafka?**  
   - **English Answer:** Focus on partitioning, replication, fault tolerance, and ensuring message delivery guarantees.  
   - **Chinese Answer:** 重点讨论分区、复制、容错以及确保消息传递保证。

3. **What challenges would you face in designing a scalable social media platform?**  
   - **English Answer:** Discuss handling user growth, newsfeed updates, and real-time notifications, while ensuring data consistency.  
   - **Chinese Answer:** 讨论如何处理用户增长、新闻源更新和实时通知，同时确保数据一致性。

4. **How would you design a file storage system like Google Drive?**  
   - **English Answer:** Talk about file storage, metadata management, permissions, and synchronization across devices.  
   - **Chinese Answer:** 讨论文件存储、元数据管理、权限和跨设备同步。

5. **How would you ensure security in a payment processing system?**  
   - **English Answer:** Include encryption, secure authentication, transaction logging, and compliance with regulatory standards.  
   - **Chinese Answer:** 包括加密、身份验证、事务日志记录和遵守法规标准。

#### 6. **Summary（总结）**

- **English:** Common system design interview questions focus on your ability to create scalable, reliable systems by addressing challenges like load balancing, fault tolerance, and data management. Effective answers should break down the problem, consider real-world constraints, and explain trade-offs. These questions aim to assess both your technical skills and your approach to problem-solving.  
- **Chinese:** 常见的系统设计面试问题重点考察你应对负载均衡、容错和数据管理等挑战的能力，以创建可扩展、可靠的系统。有效的回答应分解问题，考虑现实约束，并解释权衡。这些问题旨在评估你的技术技能和解决问题的思维方式。
