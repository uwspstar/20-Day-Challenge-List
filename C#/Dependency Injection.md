### What is Dependency Injection (DI) in ASP.NET MVC?

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to implement **Inversion of Control (IoC)**, which is a principle that helps to decouple the creation of object instances from their use. In ASP.NET MVC, **DI** allows you to inject dependencies (services or objects that a class relies on) into a controller or other components rather than creating them directly inside the class. This improves code testability, maintainability, and flexibility by managing object lifetimes and resolving dependencies centrally.

### How DI Works in ASP.NET MVC

In ASP.NET MVC, **DI** typically works in conjunction with an IoC (Inversion of Control) container, which manages the lifecycle and instantiation of services or dependencies. This container is configured to resolve dependencies automatically.

ASP.NET MVC doesn't provide built-in dependency injection until ASP.NET Core, but you can use third-party libraries like **Ninject**, **Autofac**, **Unity**, or even the **SimpleInjector**. These libraries allow you to register and resolve dependencies at runtime.

### Key Concepts:

- **Service**: A reusable object or logic that other components depend on.
- **Dependency**: The service or object that a component (e.g., a controller) requires to function.
- **IoC Container**: A framework that manages the creation, lifecycle, and disposal of dependencies.

### Basic Example of DI with ASP.NET MVC

Let’s break down an example step by step using the **Unity** IoC container for DI in ASP.NET MVC.

#### 1. Install the IoC Container (Unity)

First, install the **Unity** container via NuGet in your MVC project.

```bash
Install-Package Unity.Mvc
```

This will install Unity along with the necessary packages to integrate it into an ASP.NET MVC project.

#### 2. Define a Service Interface and Implementation

Let’s create a service that we will inject into a controller.

```csharp
// IHelloService.cs
public interface IHelloService
{
    string SayHello(string name);
}

// HelloService.cs
public class HelloService : IHelloService
{
    public string SayHello(string name)
    {
        return $"Hello, {name}!";
    }
}
```

#### 3. Register the Service in Unity

Now, configure the **Unity IoC container** to resolve the dependency by registering the `IHelloService` and its implementation `HelloService`.

```csharp
// UnityConfig.cs
using System.Web.Mvc;
using Unity;
using Unity.Mvc5;

public static class UnityConfig
{
    public static void RegisterComponents()
    {
        var container = new UnityContainer();

        // Register the service
        container.RegisterType<IHelloService, HelloService>();

        // Set the dependency resolver to use Unity
        DependencyResolver.SetResolver(new UnityDependencyResolver(container));
    }
}
```

In this configuration, `UnityConfig` registers the `IHelloService` interface to be resolved by an instance of `HelloService`. The `DependencyResolver` is set up to use the Unity container, enabling DI across the MVC application.

#### 4. Modify Global.asax to Initialize Unity

Next, ensure that the DI configuration is applied when the application starts by modifying `Global.asax`.

```csharp
// Global.asax.cs
protected void Application_Start()
{
    UnityConfig.RegisterComponents(); // Register the Unity container
    AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();
    RouteConfig.RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);
}
```

#### 5. Inject the Dependency into a Controller

Now that DI is set up, you can inject `IHelloService` into any controller.

```csharp
// HomeController.cs
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly IHelloService _helloService;

    // Dependency injection via constructor
    public HomeController(IHelloService helloService)
    {
        _helloService = helloService;
    }

    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        string message = _helloService.SayHello("World");
        ViewBag.Message = message;
        return View();
    }
}
```

#### 6. View the Result

In the `Index.cshtml` view, you can display the message returned by the `HelloService`.

```html
<!-- Index.cshtml -->
@{
    ViewBag.Title = "Home Page";
}

<h2>@ViewBag.Message</h2>
```

When you run the application, the `HomeController` will have `IHelloService` injected into it by Unity, and the message "Hello, World!" will be displayed on the view.

### Why Use Dependency Injection?

- **Loose Coupling**: Classes don’t need to know about how dependencies are created or managed.
- **Testability**: DI makes it easier to test your application by injecting mock dependencies during testing.
- **Maintainability**: If the way a dependency is implemented changes, you don’t need to modify the code that uses the dependency.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class focuses only on its primary role and delegates dependency management to the DI container.

### Life Cycle of Objects in DI

1. **Transient**: A new instance of the service is created each time it’s requested.
2. **Scoped**: A new instance is created for each request (lifetime of the HTTP request).
3. **Singleton**: A single instance of the service is created and shared across the application.

These lifetimes can be configured in Unity or other IoC containers when registering services.

### Common IoC Containers for ASP.NET MVC

1. **Unity**: A lightweight IoC container by Microsoft, commonly used in ASP.NET MVC.
2. **Autofac**: A popular container with advanced features like property injection and lifetime management.
3. **Ninject**: A flexible container with support for extensions.
4. **SimpleInjector**: A fast, simple, and lightweight container.

### Registering Different Lifetimes in Unity:

```csharp
// UnityConfig.cs
container.RegisterType<IHelloService, HelloService>(); // Transient by default
container.RegisterSingleton<IHelloService, HelloService>(); // Singleton
container.RegisterType<IHelloService, HelloService>(new HierarchicalLifetimeManager()); // Scoped (request-based)
```

### DI for Action Method Parameters

In some cases, you can inject dependencies directly into action methods using the `ActionFilter` attributes or a **Service Locator** pattern, but it is generally better to use constructor injection as shown above for simplicity and maintainability.

### Summary

- **What**: DI is a design pattern that manages object creation and lifecycle by injecting dependencies into classes.
- **Why**: It improves code maintainability, testability, and promotes loose coupling.
- **When**: You use DI when your controllers or classes depend on external services or objects.
- **Where**: DI is typically set up in the `Global.asax` or `Startup.cs` (in .NET Core) and used in controllers or services.
- **Who**: Developers use DI to write better-structured, testable, and flexible applications.

### Comparison of IoC Containers

| IoC Container   | Pros                                    | Cons                                    |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Unity**       | Simple to use, integrated with MVC      | Limited advanced features               |
| **Autofac**     | Rich features, lifetime management      | Steeper learning curve                  |
| **Ninject**     | Flexible, lots of extensions            | Slower performance in some cases        |
| **SimpleInjector** | Fast, simple, lightweight              | Not as feature-rich as Autofac or Ninject|

### Tips:
1. **Constructor Injection**: It’s the preferred way to inject dependencies. Avoid property or method injection unless necessary.
2. **Avoid Service Locator**: While a Service Locator can be used to resolve dependencies manually, it leads to tight coupling and is generally considered an anti-pattern.
3. **Register Interfaces**: Always register interfaces or abstract classes in the IoC container, not concrete implementations directly.

### Warning:
- Be cautious when using **Singleton** services that depend on **Scoped** or **Transient** services, as this can lead to inconsistent object lifetimes and threading issues.
