# .Net Core Interview Questions

Sure! Letâ€™s go through each question in detail, providing explanations and code examples as appropriate.

### 1. What is .NET Core?
**.NET Core** is a cross-platform, open-source framework for building modern applications. It allows developers to create applications that can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Code Example:**
```bash
dotnet new console -n HelloWorld
cd HelloWorld
dotnet run
```
This command creates and runs a simple console application.

### [2. Advantages of .NET Core Over .NET Framework]()
- **Cross-Platform:** Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **Performance:** Generally faster than .NET Framework due to optimizations.
- **Microservices Ready:** Designed for building microservices.
- **Lightweight:** Smaller footprint compared to .NET Framework.

### 3. Explain Default Project Structure
A typical .NET Core project contains:
- **Program.cs:** Entry point of the application.
- **Startup.cs:** Configures services and the app's request pipeline.
- **appsettings.json:** Configuration settings.
- **Controllers/Views:** For MVC applications.

### 4. Role of Program.cs File
**Program.cs** contains the `Main` method, the entry point of the application. It initializes the host for the application.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
public class Program
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        CreateHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
    }

    public static IHostBuilder CreateHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
        Host.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
            .ConfigureWebHostDefaults(webBuilder =>
            {
                webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();
            });
}
```

### 5. What is the Role of Startup.cs File?
**Startup.cs** is where you configure services and the app's request pipeline.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddControllers();
    }

    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        app.UseRouting();
        app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
        {
            endpoints.MapControllers();
        });
    }
}
```

### 6. What is the Role of ConfigureServices & Configure Method?
- **ConfigureServices:** Used to register application services (e.g., DI, MVC).
- **Configure:** Sets up the middleware pipeline.

### [7. What is Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core?]()
**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
public interface IGreeter
{
    string Greet(string name);
}

public class Greeter : IGreeter
{
    public string Greet(string name) => $"Hello, {name}!";
}

public class Startup
{
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddSingleton<IGreeter, Greeter>();
    }
}
```

### 8. What are the Types of Service Lifetimes in ASP.NET Core?
1. **Transient:** Created each time they are requested.
2. **Scoped:** Created once per request.
3. **Singleton:** Created once and shared throughout the application's lifetime.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
services.AddTransient<ITransientService, TransientService>();
services.AddScoped<IScopedService, ScopedService>();
services.AddSingleton<ISingletonService, SingletonService>();
```

### [9. What is Middleware in ASP.NET Core?]
**Middleware** are software components that are assembled into an application pipeline to handle requests and responses.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
public class CustomMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public CustomMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        // Custom logic before
        await _next(context); // Call next middleware
        // Custom logic after
    }
}
```

### 10. What is Kestrel?
**Kestrel** is a cross-platform web server for ASP.NET Core that can handle HTTP requests.

### 11. What is the Difference Between Kestrel and IIS?
- **Kestrel:** Lightweight, cross-platform, best for development or as a reverse proxy.
- **IIS:** A full-fledged web server primarily for Windows environments, provides features like application pools.

### 12. What is Request Delegate?
A **request delegate** is a method that handles HTTP requests in ASP.NET Core.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
app.Run(async (context) =>
{
    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello, World!");
});
```

### 13. What is Host in ASP.NET Core?
The **host** is responsible for managing app startup, configuration, dependency injection, and the request pipeline.

### 14. What are the Various Techniques to Save Configuration Settings in ASP.NET Core?
- **appsettings.json**
- **Environment Variables**
- **User Secrets (for development)**
- **Command-line Arguments**

### 15. How Does Routing Work?
Routing in ASP.NET Core maps incoming HTTP requests to corresponding controller actions.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
app.UseRouting();

app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.MapGet("/hello", async context =>
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
    });
});
```

### 16. Explain Attribute Routing
**Attribute Routing** allows you to specify routes using attributes in the controller actions.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class HelloController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{name}")]
    public ActionResult<string> Get(string name) => $"Hello, {name}!";
}
```

### 17. Complete Request Processing Pipeline
The request processing pipeline consists of middleware components configured in the `Configure` method, such as routing, authentication, and authorization.

### 18. Can ASP.NET Core Application Work with .NET 4.X Framework?
ASP.NET Core applications are not compatible with .NET Framework 4.x but can target .NET 5.0 and later versions, which unify the platforms.

### 19. What is a Metapackage?
A **metapackage** is a package that includes references to other packages. For example, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.App` is a metapackage for ASP.NET Core.

### 20. How Does ASP.NET Core Serve Static Files?
ASP.NET Core serves static files like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the `UseStaticFiles` middleware.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseStaticFiles();
}
```

### 21. Various JSON Files
ASP.NET Core uses JSON files for configuration, typically `appsettings.json`, which can store various settings.

### 22. What is .NET Standard?
**.NET Standard** is a specification that defines a set of APIs that all .NET implementations must implement, allowing for code sharing across platforms.

### 23. What are Razor Pages?
**Razor Pages** is a page-based programming model in ASP.NET Core for building web applications. It simplifies the way you build web UI.

### 24. What is Dependency Injection?
As explained earlier, DI allows for better modularity and testing of applications by injecting dependencies rather than hardcoding them.

### [25. What is Custom Middleware?]()
Custom middleware is a user-defined middleware component that can handle requests and responses.

### 26. Explain Session and State Management
**Session Management** stores user data while the user is interacting with the application. ASP.NET Core uses middleware to manage sessions.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSession();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseSession();
}
```

### 27. Explain Model Validation
**Model Validation** ensures that incoming data meets certain criteria before processing it.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
public class User
{
    [Required]
    public string Name { get; set; }
    [EmailAddress]
    public string Email { get; set; }
}
```

### 28. How to Handle Errors?
ASP.NET Core provides built-in error handling middleware.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
```

### 29. How to Enable Session?
To enable sessions, add session services and middleware.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSession();
}

public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseSession();
}
```

### 30. Explain Model Binding
**Model Binding** is the process of mapping HTTP request data to action method parameters.

**Code Example:**
```csharp
[HttpPost]
public IActionResult Create(User user)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        // Save user
    }
    return View(user);
}
```
