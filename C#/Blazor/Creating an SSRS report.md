Creating an SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) report using the Northwind database involves several steps. Here is a step-by-step guide:

---

### Prerequisites:
1. **SQL Server** with SSRS installed.
2. **Northwind Database** installed on your SQL Server instance. (Download it from Microsoft's sample databases if needed.)
3. **SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)** or **Visual Studio** with the SSRS extension installed.

---

### Step 1: Verify the Northwind Database
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
2. Connect to your SQL Server instance.
3. Check if the Northwind database is available under `Databases`. If not, restore or attach the Northwind database.

---

### Step 2: Create an SSRS Project
1. Open **SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)** or **Visual Studio**.
2. Click **File > New > Project**.
3. Select **Reporting Services > Report Server Project**.
4. Name your project (e.g., "NorthwindReports") and click **OK**.

---

### Step 3: Add a Data Source
1. Right-click **Shared Data Sources** in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select **Add New Data Source**.
3. Enter a name (e.g., "NorthwindDataSource").
4. Set the **Type** to "Microsoft SQL Server".
5. Click **Edit** to configure the connection:
   - Server name: Your SQL Server instance (e.g., `localhost` or `UWSPSTAR`).
   - Authentication: Use appropriate credentials.
   - Select the **Northwind** database.
6. Test the connection and click **OK**.

---

### Step 4: Add a Dataset
1. Right-click **Shared Datasets** in the Solution Explorer.
2. Select **Add New Dataset**.
3. Name the dataset (e.g., "NorthwindOrders").
4. Set the data source to the shared data source created earlier.
5. Use a query or stored procedure to fetch the data. For example:
   ```sql
   SELECT OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, ShipCountry, Freight
   FROM Orders
   WHERE ShipCountry = 'USA';
   ```
6. Click **OK**.

---

### Step 5: Design the Report
1. Right-click **Reports** in the Solution Explorer and select **Add New Item > Report**.
2. Drag and drop a **Table** or **Matrix** control from the toolbox onto the design surface.
3. Connect the table to the dataset:
   - Drag fields from the dataset into the table columns.
4. Customize the headers, format the columns, and apply any required styles.

---

### Step 6: Preview the Report
1. Save your report.
2. Click **Preview** to view the report within the designer.

---

### Step 7: Deploy the Report
1. Right-click the project in Solution Explorer and select **Properties**.
2. Set the **TargetServerURL** to your SSRS server URL (e.g., `http://localhost/ReportServer`).
3. Right-click the project and select **Deploy**.

---

### Step 8: View the Report in the Browser
1. Open your SSRS portal (e.g., `http://localhost/Reports`).
2. Navigate to the folder where your report is deployed.
3. Run the report.
