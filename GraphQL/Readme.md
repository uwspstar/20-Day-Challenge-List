### 3-Day GraphQL Learning Plan

#### Day 1: Introduction to GraphQL and Basic Concepts
- **Overview of GraphQL**
  - Understand the core idea of GraphQL and how it differs from REST.
  - Explore use cases where GraphQL is most beneficial.
  
- **Key Concepts**
  - **Query Language**: Learn how to structure GraphQL queries.
  - **Schema Definition**: Understand the role of schemas in defining data types and structure.
  - **Resolvers**: Study how GraphQL resolves queries through resolvers, connecting queries to the underlying data source.
  - **Mutations**: Learn how mutations work for modifying data.

- **Hands-on Practice**
  - Set up a basic GraphQL server using a framework like Apollo Server (Node.js).
  - Create a schema and implement basic queries and mutations.
  
#### Day 2: Advanced GraphQL Concepts and Features
- **GraphQL Queries and Variables**
  - Learn how to pass variables into queries and use arguments to make queries dynamic.
  
- **Fragments and Aliases**
  - Understand how to reuse query parts using fragments.
  - Learn to use aliases for renaming query results.
  
- **Pagination and Filtering**
  - Explore strategies for implementing pagination and filtering in GraphQL queries.
  
- **Error Handling**
  - Study best practices for handling errors in GraphQL to ensure robustness.
  
- **Hands-on Practice**
  - Extend the GraphQL server from Day 1 by adding fragments, pagination, and filtering to your queries.
  - Implement error handling in your server.

#### Day 3: Performance Optimization and Security in GraphQL
- **Performance Optimization**
  - **Batching and Caching**: Learn how to use tools like `DataLoader` to batch and cache GraphQL requests.
  - **Query Complexity Analysis**: Study how to limit query depth and complexity to prevent abuse.

- **Security Considerations**
  - **Authentication and Authorization**: Learn how to integrate authentication mechanisms like JWT in GraphQL.
  - **Rate Limiting and Throttling**: Explore strategies to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
  
- **Subscriptions in GraphQL**
  - Understand how to implement real-time data updates using GraphQL subscriptions with WebSockets.

- **Hands-on Practice**
  - Implement caching and batching in your GraphQL server for performance optimization.
  - Add authentication and authorization to the GraphQL server to secure queries and mutations.
  - Implement a simple real-time feature using GraphQL subscriptions.

This 3-day plan introduces both the fundamentals and advanced features of GraphQL, allowing for hands-on practice in building and securing a performant GraphQL API.
