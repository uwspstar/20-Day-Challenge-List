### 1. **What is Angular?**
Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source framework developed by Google, used to build web applications, especially single-page applications (SPAs).

```typescript
// Basic Angular component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'my-angular-app';
}
```

---

### 2. **What are Angular advantages?**
- **Modularity**: Code is organized in modules, making the application easier to maintain.
- **Two-way Data Binding**: Changes in the view are reflected in the model and vice versa.
- **Dependency Injection**: Promotes better testing and design by injecting dependencies.
- **TypeScript Support**: TypeScript adds strong typing and better tooling support.
- **High Performance**: Provides optimizations like Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation.

---

### 3. **What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?**
- **AngularJS**: Based on JavaScript, uses a MVC architecture, and works with directives like `ng-bind`, `ng-model`.
- **Angular (Angular 2+)**: Based on TypeScript, uses a component-based architecture, and has improved performance.

```typescript
// AngularJS example
angular.module('myApp', []).controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
  $scope.message = 'Hello AngularJS!';
});

// Angular example
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: '<h1>{{ message }}</h1>',
})
export class AppComponent {
  message = 'Hello Angular!';
}
```

---

### 4. **What is NPM?**
NPM stands for Node Package Manager, a tool that allows you to install libraries, packages, and dependencies for your Angular project.

```bash
# Installing Angular CLI with npm
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

---

### 5. **What is CLI tool?**
CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool that allows you to scaffold, build, and maintain Angular applications via commands.

```bash
# Creating a new Angular project
ng new my-angular-app

# Serving the Angular application
ng serve
```

---

### 6. **What are Components in Angular?**
Components are the fundamental building blocks of Angular applications. They control a part of the screen (view) and consist of a template, styles, and logic.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello',
  template: '<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>',
})
export class HelloComponent {
  name = 'Angular';
}
```

---

### 7. **What is a Selector and Template?**
- **Selector**: Defines the HTML tag where the component will be rendered.
- **Template**: Defines the view, written in HTML, and optionally using Angular directives.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello',
  template: '<h1>Hello {{ name }}</h1>',
})
export class HelloComponent {
  name = 'Angular';
}
```

---

### 8. **What is Module in Angular? What is app.module.ts file?**
Modules are containers for components, services, directives, etc. The `app.module.ts` file is the root module where components are declared, and the Angular app starts.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

---

### 9. **How an Angular App gets Loaded and Started? What are index.html, app-root, selector, and main.ts?**
- **index.html**: Entry HTML file, includes `<app-root></app-root>`.
- **app-root**: The selector for the root component, defined in `app.component.ts`.
- **main.ts**: The main entry point for the Angular app, bootstraps the `AppModule`.

```typescript
// main.ts
platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

---

### 10. **What is a Bootstrapped Module & Bootstrapped Component?**
- **Bootstrapped Module**: The root module that starts the Angular application.
- **Bootstrapped Component**: The root component that Angular renders when the application starts.

```typescript
// app.module.ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

---

### [11. **What is Data Binding in Angular?**](https://github.com/uwspstar/20-Day-Challenge-List/blob/main/Angular/Angular%20Interview/What%20is%20Data%20Binding%20in%20Angular.md)
Data Binding refers to the synchronization between the model and the view in Angular.

```html
<!-- Two-way data binding -->
<input [(ngModel)]="username" />
<p>Your username is: {{ username }}</p>

```

---

### 15. **What is Two-way Binding in Angular?**
Two-way binding allows the synchronization of data between the view and the component.

```html
<!-- Two-way binding with ngModel -->
<input [(ngModel)]="username" />
```

---

### 16. **What are Directives? What are the types of directives?**
Directives are special markers that Angular uses to apply behavior to elements.
- **Structural Directives**: Modify the DOM (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).
- **Attribute Directives**: Modify the appearance or behavior of elements (e.g., `[ngStyle]`, `[ngClass]`).

---

`*ngFor` loops through an array and renders elements for each item.

```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item }}</li>
</ul>
```

---

### 19. **What is *ngSwitch Structural directive?**
`*ngSwitch` allows you to conditionally display one element out of many options.

```html
<div [ngSwitch]="role">
  <p *ngSwitchCase="'admin'">Admin</p>
  <p *ngSwitchCase="'user'">User</p>
  <p *ngSwitchDefault>Guest</p>
</div>
```

---

### 20. **What is [ngStyle] Attribute directive?**

- **Component Directives**: Define a template with a selector (e.g., `<app-component>`).
- **Attribute Directives**: Modify the appearance or behavior of elements (e.g., `[ngClass]`).
- **Structural Directives**: Modify the structure of the DOM (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).

---

### 23. **What is Decorator?**
A decorator is a special type of declaration that modifies classes or properties.

```typescript

### 30. **What is Hierarchical Dependency Injection?**
Angularâ€™s DI allows services to be registered at different levels such as root, module, or component, giving you control over service scope.

---

### 31. **What is Provider in Angular?**
A provider tells Angular how to create a service.

---

### 32. **What is the role of @Injectable Decorator in a Service?**
Marks a class as injectable to be used in dependency injection.

```

---

### 34. **What are Lifecycle Hooks in Angular?**
Lifecycle hooks are methods that allow you to hook into key events in a component's life cycle.

```typescript
ngOnInit() {
  console.log('Component initialized');
}
```

---

### 35. **What is a Constructor in Angular?**
A constructor is used for class instantiation in Angular and is called when the class is initialized.

### 36. **What is ngOnInit lifecycle hook in Angular?**
`ngOnInit` is called after Angular initializes the component's data-bound properties.

---

### 37. **What is the difference between constructor and ngOnInit?**
- **Constructor**: Used to initialize the class.
- **ngOnInit**: Used to handle additional initialization logic after the componentâ€™s properties are set.

---

### 38. **What are Asynchronous operations?**
Asynchronous operations run separately from the main program flow and are typically used for tasks like HTTP requests.

```typescript
this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data').subscribe(data => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

---

### 39. **What is the difference between Promise and Observable?**
- **Promise**: Handles a single asynchronous event.
- **Observable**: Handles multiple asynchronous events over time.

```

---

### 46. **What are Built-in/Primitive and User-Defined/Non-primitive Types in Typescript?**
- **Primitive types**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`.
- **User-defined types**: Interfaces, classes, and types defined by the user.

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

---

### 47. **What is "any" type in Typescript?**
The `any` type disables type-checking for that variable.

```typescript
let value: any = 'Hello';
value = 123; // No error
```

---

### 48. **What is Enum type in Typescript?**
Enums allow you to define a set of named constants.
