### Highlights:
- **Standalone Components**: Angular v15 made standalone components stable, while v16 and v17 improved and optimized their usage. Angular v18 is expected to continue this trend.
- **Signal-Based Reactivity**: Introduced in v16 as an experimental feature and is expected to become fully stable in Angular v18.
- **Zone.js Optional**: With v16, Angular made Zone.js optional, and Angular v18 is expected to fully phase it out.
- **Build Performance**: Continuous improvements with each version, leading to faster builds and smaller bundle sizes in Angular v18.

This table captures the key updates and trends over these Angular versions.
