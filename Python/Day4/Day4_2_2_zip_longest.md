### Code Overview

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        return ''.join(a + b for a, b in zip_longest(word1, word2, fillvalue=''))
```

### Purpose of the Code

The purpose of this function `mergeAlternately` is to take two strings, `word1` and `word2`, and merge them by alternating characters from each string. If one string is shorter, the remaining characters from the longer string are appended to the result.

### Breakdown of the Code

1. **Function Definition**:
    ```python
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
    ```
    - `mergeAlternately` is a method of the `Solution` class.
    - It takes two arguments, `word1` and `word2`, both of which are expected to be strings (`str`).
    - The method returns a string, as indicated by the return type annotation `-> str`.

2. **Using `zip_longest`**:
    ```python
    return ''.join(a + b for a, b in zip_longest(word1, word2, fillvalue=''))
    ```
    - The `zip_longest` function is imported from the `itertools` module, which is not shown here but is a standard Python library function.
    - `zip_longest` is similar to the `zip` function, but it can handle input iterables (like strings) of different lengths.
    - When using `zip`, if the input iterables are of unequal lengths, it stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted. However, `zip_longest` continues until the longest iterable is exhausted, filling in the missing values with a specified `fillvalue`.

3. **Merging the Strings**:
    - The expression `zip_longest(word1, word2, fillvalue='')` pairs elements from `word1` and `word2`.
    - If `word1` is longer than `word2`, the remaining characters of `word1` will be paired with the `fillvalue`, which is an empty string `''`.
    - Similarly, if `word2` is longer than `word1`, its remaining characters will be paired with `''`.

4. **Generating the Result**:
    - The list comprehension `a + b for a, b in zip_longest(word1, word2, fillvalue='')` iterates over the paired elements returned by `zip_longest`.
    - For each pair `(a, b)`, it concatenates `a` and `b`.
    - These concatenated pairs are then joined together into a single string using `''.join(...)`.

5. **Return Value**:
    - The final result is a string where characters from `word1` and `word2` are alternated. If one string is shorter, the remaining characters from the longer string are added at the end.

### Example

Let's go through an example to see how this works in practice.

```python
word1 = "abc"
word2 = "defgh"
```

- `zip_longest(word1, word2, fillvalue='')` will generate:
  ```
  ('a', 'd'), ('b', 'e'), ('c', 'f'), ('', 'g'), ('', 'h')
  ```
- The list comprehension generates:
  ```
  'ad', 'be', 'cf', 'g', 'h'
  ```
- Finally, `''.join(...)` concatenates these strings into:
  ```
  "adbecfgh"
  ```

So, the result of `mergeAlternately("abc", "defgh")` is `"adbecfgh"`.

### Key Concepts

1. **`zip_longest`**: This function is crucial for handling cases where the input strings have different lengths, ensuring that no characters are left out in the final merged string.
2. **String Concatenation**: The approach effectively combines characters from both strings, ensuring the desired alternating pattern.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code handles cases where one or both strings might be empty, thanks to the use of `fillvalue=''` in `zip_longest`.

### Final Thoughts

This method provides an elegant and concise way to merge two strings alternately, using Python's powerful `itertools.zip_longest` function and string manipulation techniques. The code is efficient and handles edge cases well, making it a robust solution for the problem at hand.
