### Day 1: Introduction to Kafka and Core Concepts
**Goal:** Understand the basic concepts and architecture of Kafka.

**Key Topics:**
- [What is Kafka? Why use it?](https://github.com/uwspstar/20-Day-Challenge-List/blob/main/Kafka/What%20is%20Kafka%3F%20Why%20use%20it.md)
- Kafka architecture overview: Brokers, Topics, Producers, Consumers, Partitions, and Offsets.
- How Kafka compares with other messaging systems like RabbitMQ or ActiveMQ.
  
**Hands-on Task:**
- Set up Kafka on your local machine using Docker or direct installation.
- Create a simple producer and consumer in Python or Java.
  
**Resources:**
- Official Kafka documentation [Kafka Quickstart](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart).
- Hands-on tutorial for setting up Kafka on Docker.

---

### Day 2: Kafka Topics, Producers, and Consumers
**Goal:** Learn how to create, manage, and interact with Kafka topics.

**Key Topics:**
- Detailed understanding of Kafka topics, partitions, and replication.
- How Producers work: Sending messages to Kafka topics.
- How Consumers work: Reading messages from Kafka topics.

**Hands-on Task:**
- Create and configure Kafka topics.
- Build a Kafka producer and consumer using your preferred programming language (Python, Java, etc.).
- Experiment with sending and receiving messages.

**Resources:**
- Kafka Official Tutorial on Producers & Consumers.
- Example code for creating Kafka Producers and Consumers [GitHub example](https://github.com/topics/kafka-producer-consumer).

### Day 3: Kafka Streams and Real-Time Processing
**Goal:** Understand how Kafka handles real-time stream processing.

**Key Topics:**
- Introduction to Kafka Streams API.
- Event-driven architecture and stream processing basics.
- Understanding stream transformations: map, filter, and aggregate operations.

**Hands-on Task:**
- Set up a Kafka Streams application that reads from a topic, processes the stream (e.g., counting occurrences of words), and writes the results to another topic.
- Explore simple transformations like map and filter.

**Resources:**
- Kafka Streams API documentation.
- Hands-on Kafka Streams examples from [Confluent.io](https://developer.confluent.io/get-started/).

---

### Day 4: Kafka Connect and Integrating with Other Systems
**Goal:** Learn how to integrate Kafka with external systems using Kafka Connect.

**Key Topics:**
- Introduction to Kafka Connect.
- Kafka connectors: Source and Sink connectors.
- Common use cases: Connecting Kafka to databases, REST APIs, and cloud storage.

**Hands-on Task:**
- Set up Kafka Connect and install a few connectors (e.g., JDBC for databases, Elasticsearch for search).
- Create a pipeline that moves data between Kafka and an external system.

**Resources:**
- Kafka Connect Documentation.
- Example connectors [Confluent Hub](https://www.confluent.io/hub/).

### Day 5: Kafka Security and Configuration
**Goal:** Understand Kafka’s security model and learn how to secure your Kafka cluster.

**Key Topics:**
- Kafka security features: SSL encryption, Authentication (SASL), and Authorization (ACLs).
- Configuring Kafka for secure communication.
- Common Kafka configurations for performance tuning.

**Hands-on Task:**
- Set up SSL encryption for communication between Kafka brokers, producers, and consumers.
- Implement basic ACLs to restrict access to certain topics.

**Resources:**
- Kafka Security documentation.
- Example of Kafka security setup: [Kafka Security by Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/blog/apache-kafka-security-authorization-authentication-encryption-auditing/).

---

### Day 6: Kafka Cluster Management and Monitoring
**Goal:** Learn how to manage, monitor, and optimize a Kafka cluster.

**Key Topics:**
- Kafka cluster management: Replication, scaling, and load balancing.
- Monitoring Kafka using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Confluent Control Center.
- Troubleshooting common Kafka issues (e.g., consumer lag, partition unavailability).

**Hands-on Task:**
- Set up a Kafka cluster with multiple brokers and partitions.
- Implement Kafka monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
- Simulate high-load scenarios and observe Kafka performance.

**Resources:**
- Monitoring Kafka with Prometheus and Grafana: [Blog Post](https://medium.com/bakdata/monitoring-apache-kafka-with-prometheus-and-grafana-3267b66b22b7).
- Kafka Operations guide.

---

### Day 7: Advanced Kafka: Log Compaction, Exactly-Once Semantics, and Tuning
**Goal:** Dive deep into advanced Kafka features and best practices.

**Key Topics:**
- Log compaction and use cases for data retention.
- Exactly-once semantics: How Kafka ensures data consistency.
- Performance tuning tips for Kafka (batching, compression, replication).

**Hands-on Task:**
- Implement a Kafka application with exactly-once semantics.
- Experiment with log compaction in Kafka and understand its impact on storage.
- Optimize Kafka producer and consumer configurations for performance.

**Resources:**
- Exactly-once Semantics in Kafka [Confluent blog](https://www.confluent.io/blog/enabling-exactly-once-kafka-streams/).
- Kafka Performance Tuning Guide.

---

### Bonus: Build a Kafka Project (Optional)
**Goal:** Apply everything you've learned by building a real-world Kafka project.

**Key Project Ideas:**
- Real-time analytics dashboard using Kafka Streams.
- Event-driven microservices architecture using Kafka for communication.
- Data pipeline with Kafka, Kafka Connect, and external databases.

**Hands-on Task:**
- Pick a project that suits your interests and apply Kafka as the messaging system or streaming platform.

**Resources:**
- Example Kafka projects on GitHub.
- Confluent’s developer resources.
