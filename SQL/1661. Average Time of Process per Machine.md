### SQL Code:

```sql
SELECT machine_id, 
       ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 3) AS processing_time
FROM (
    SELECT machine_id, 
           process_id,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END) AS end_time,
           MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END) AS start_time
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
) AS process_times
GROUP BY machine_id;
```

### Explanation:

1. **Subquery**:
   - We use a **subquery** to calculate the start and end times for each `machine_id` and `process_id` pair.
   - The `MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END)` retrieves the `end` timestamp for each process, and `MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END)` retrieves the `start` timestamp.
   - The `GROUP BY machine_id, process_id` ensures that we group the rows by both `machine_id` and `process_id`, which are unique pairs as described in the schema.

   **Subquery** Explanation in Chinese:
   - 我们使用子查询来计算每个 `machine_id` 和 `process_id` 对应的开始和结束时间。
   - `MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'end' THEN timestamp END)` 获取每个过程的 `end` 时间戳，`MAX(CASE WHEN activity_type = 'start' THEN timestamp END)` 获取 `start` 时间戳。
   - `GROUP BY machine_id, process_id` 确保我们按 `machine_id` 和 `process_id` 分组，这些是唯一的组合。

2. **SELECT machine_id, ROUND(AVG(end_time - start_time), 3) AS processing_time**:
   - After obtaining the start and end times for each process, we calculate the difference (`end_time - start_time`) for each process to get the process duration.
   - The `AVG()` function is used to calculate the average processing time for each machine.
   - We use `ROUND()` to round the result to 3 decimal places, as required by the problem.
   - Finally, we group the results by `machine_id` to get the average processing time for each machine.

   **Explanation in Chinese**:
   - 获取每个过程的开始和结束时间后，我们计算每个过程的持续时间 (`end_time - start_time`)。
   - 使用 `AVG()` 函数来计算每台机器的平均处理时间。
   - 使用 `ROUND()` 将结果保留到小数点后 3 位。
   - 最后，按 `machine_id` 分组，获取每台机器的平均处理时间。

3. **GROUP BY machine_id**:
   - The final `GROUP BY machine_id` ensures that the average processing time is calculated for each machine individually.

   **Explanation in Chinese**:
   - 最后的 `GROUP BY machine_id` 确保我们为每台机器分别计算平均处理时间。

### Key Concepts:

- **Subquery with Aggregation**:  
   In the subquery, we use `MAX()` with a `CASE WHEN` clause to extract the `start` and `end` timestamps from the `Activity` table. This ensures that we get both timestamps for each `process_id` and `machine_id`.

   **带聚合的子查询**:  
   在子查询中，我们使用 `MAX()` 和 `CASE WHEN` 子句从 `Activity` 表中提取 `start` 和 `end` 时间戳。这确保我们获取每个 `process_id` 和 `machine_id` 的两个时间戳。

- **Time Difference**:  
   The time difference (`end_time - start_time`) gives us the duration for each process, and averaging this difference provides the average processing time for each machine.

   **时间差**:  
   时间差 (`end_time - start_time`) 提供每个过程的持续时间，计算此差值的平均值可以得到每台机器的平均处理时间。

- **ROUND()**:  
   We use the `ROUND()` function to round the result to 3 decimal places, as required.

   **ROUND() 函数**:  
   使用 `ROUND()` 函数将结果四舍五入到小数点后 3 位。

### Warnings:

- **Consistency in Time Units**:  
   Ensure that the `timestamp` values in the `Activity` table are consistent in terms of time units (e.g., seconds). Since the question specifies `timestamp` as a float representing seconds, the calculation should proceed without issues.

   **时间单位的一致性**:  
   确保 `Activity` 表中的 `timestamp` 值的时间单位一致（例如，秒）。问题中指定 `timestamp` 是表示秒的浮点数，因此计算应该不会有问题。

### Summary:
This query calculates the average time each machine takes to complete a process by calculating the time difference between `end` and `start` timestamps for each process and then averaging these values for each `machine_id`. The result is rounded to 3 decimal places, as required.

**中文总结**:  
该查询通过计算每个过程的 `end` 和 `start` 时间戳之间的时间差来计算每台机器完成一个过程的平均时间，然后为每个 `machine_id` 取这些值的平均值。结果保留到小数点后三位。

### Tips:

- **Indexing for Performance**:  
   Consider adding indexes on `machine_id` and `process_id` to optimize the performance of this query, especially if the `Activity` table is large.

   **性能优化的索引**:  
   考虑在 `machine_id` 和 `process_id` 列上创建索引，以优化查询性能，特别是在 `Activity` 表很大的情况下。
