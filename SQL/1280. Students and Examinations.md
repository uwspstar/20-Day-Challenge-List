1280. Students and Examinations

https://leetcode.com/problems/students-and-examinations/description/

To solve **Leetcode 1280: Students and Examinations**, we need to display a result that includes every student and every subject, regardless of whether they attended an exam. For each student and subject, we will count how many times they attended the exam. Here's how we can do that using a SQL query.

### SQL Code:

```sql
SELECT s.student_id, 
       s.student_name, 
       subj.subject_name, 
       COALESCE(COUNT(e.student_id), 0) AS attended_exams
FROM Students s
CROSS JOIN Subjects subj
LEFT JOIN Examinations e
ON s.student_id = e.student_id 
AND subj.subject_name = e.subject_name
GROUP BY s.student_id, s.student_name, subj.subject_name
ORDER BY s.student_id, subj.subject_name;
```

### Explanation:

1. **CROSS JOIN**:
   - We use a `CROSS JOIN` between the `Students` and `Subjects` tables to ensure that every student is paired with every subject. This is important because even if a student did not attend any exams, we still need a row for each student and subject combination.
   - This creates all possible combinations of students and subjects, which will be used to display all rows, even if there are no exam records for a particular combination.

   **Explanation in Chinese**:
   - 我们使用 `CROSS JOIN` 将 `Students` 和 `Subjects` 表连接起来，以确保每个学生和每个科目都有一条记录。即使学生没有参加任何考试，我们仍然需要每个学生和科目的组合。
   - 这样创建了学生和科目的所有可能组合，即使没有考试记录，也会为每个组合显示一行。

2. **LEFT JOIN**:
   - A `LEFT JOIN` is used between the result of the `CROSS JOIN` and the `Examinations` table. This ensures that if a student attended an exam for a specific subject, we get the corresponding record from the `Examinations` table.
   - If there is no matching exam record, `NULL` values are returned for the exam fields.

   **Explanation in Chinese**:
   - 我们使用 `LEFT JOIN` 将 `CROSS JOIN` 的结果与 `Examinations` 表连接。这确保如果某个学生参加了某个科目的考试，我们可以从 `Examinations` 表中获取相应的记录。
   - 如果没有匹配的考试记录，考试字段将返回 `NULL`。

3. **COALESCE()**:
   - The `COALESCE()` function is used to return `0` if there are no records for a student and subject combination (i.e., if `COUNT(e.student_id)` is `NULL`).
   - This ensures that we count zero for students who didn’t attend an exam for a particular subject.

   **Explanation in Chinese**:
   - 我们使用 `COALESCE()` 函数，如果没有对应的学生和科目记录，返回 `0`（即，如果 `COUNT(e.student_id)` 为 `NULL`）。
   - 这样确保我们对没有参加某科目考试的学生计数为 0。

4. **GROUP BY**:
   - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by `student_id`, `student_name`, and `subject_name`. This ensures that we count the number of exams attended for each combination of student and subject.
   
   **Explanation in Chinese**:
   - `GROUP BY` 子句按 `student_id`、`student_name` 和 `subject_name` 分组。这样可以确保我们为每个学生和科目的组合计算参加的考试次数。

5. **ORDER BY**:
   - The `ORDER BY` clause ensures that the results are sorted by `student_id` and `subject_name`, as required by the problem.

   **Explanation in Chinese**:
   - `ORDER BY` 子句确保结果按 `student_id` 和 `subject_name` 排序，符合题目要求。

### Example Walkthrough:

For the given tables:

- **Students**:  
   ```
   +------------+--------------+
   | student_id | student_name  |
   +------------+--------------+
   | 1          | Alice         |
   | 2          | Bob           |
   | 13         | John          |
   | 6          | Alex          |
   +------------+--------------+
   ```

- **Subjects**:  
   ```
   +--------------+
   | subject_name |
   +--------------+
   | Math         |
   | Physics      |
   | Programming  |
   +--------------+
   ```

- **Examinations**:  
   ```
   +------------+--------------+
   | student_id | subject_name  |
   +------------+--------------+
   | 1          | Math          |
   | 1          | Physics       |
   | 1          | Programming   |
   | 2          | Programming   |
   | 1          | Physics       |
   | 1          | Math          |
   | 13         | Math          |
   | 13         | Programming   |
   | 13         | Physics       |
   | 2          | Math          |
   | 1          | Math          |
   +------------+--------------+
   ```

The output would be:
```
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| student_id | student_name  | subject_name | attended_exams |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 1          | Alice         | Math         | 3              |
| 1          | Alice         | Physics      | 2              |
| 1          | Alice         | Programming  | 1              |
| 2          | Bob           | Math         | 1              |
| 2          | Bob           | Physics      | 0              |
| 2          | Bob           | Programming  | 1              |
| 6          | Alex          | Math         | 0              |
| 6          | Alex          | Physics      | 0              |
| 6          | Alex          | Programming  | 0              |
| 13         | John          | Math         | 1              |
| 13         | John          | Physics      | 1              |
| 13         | John          | Programming  | 1              |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
```

### Key Concepts:

- **CROSS JOIN**:  
   This join creates all possible combinations of students and subjects, which is necessary to show results for all students and subjects even if no exams were attended.

   **CROSS JOIN**:  
   这种连接创建了学生和科目的所有可能组合，这是显示所有学生和科目组合的必要条件，即使没有参加考试。

- **LEFT JOIN**:  
   The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that if a student did not attend an exam for a particular subject, they still appear in the results with `0` attendance.

   **LEFT JOIN**:  
   `LEFT JOIN` 确保如果学生没有参加某个科目的考试，他们仍然出现在结果中，并且参加次数为 `0`。
