- [1148. Article Views I](https://leetcode.com/problems/article-views-i/)

### Corrected SQL Code:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT [author_id] AS id
FROM Views WITH (NOLOCK)
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY [author_id];
```

### Explanation:

1. **SELECT DISTINCT [author_id] AS id**:  
   We are selecting the `author_id` column from the `Views` table, but we are using the `DISTINCT` keyword to ensure that only unique `author_id`s are returned. The `AS id` renames the column to `id` in the result set.
   - `DISTINCT` ensures that if the same author views their own article multiple times, only one entry is returned for that author.  
   - `AS id` renames the `author_id` column to `id` for simplicity.

   我们从 `Views` 表中选择 `author_id` 列，并使用 `DISTINCT` 关键字确保只返回唯一的 `author_id`。`AS id` 将列重命名为 `id`。  
   - `DISTINCT` 确保如果同一个作者多次查看自己的文章，结果集中只返回该作者的一条记录。  
   - `AS id` 将 `author_id` 列重命名为 `id`，使结果更加简洁。

2. **FROM Views WITH (NOLOCK)**:  
   The `FROM` clause specifies the `Views` table as the source of data. The `WITH (NOLOCK)` hint is used to allow the query to read data without locking the table, which can improve performance in high-concurrency environments. However, using `NOLOCK` can result in reading uncommitted or dirty data.

   `FROM` 子句指定 `Views` 表为数据源。`WITH (NOLOCK)` 提示允许查询在不锁定表的情况下读取数据，这可以提高高并发环境下的性能。然而，使用 `NOLOCK` 可能会导致读取未提交或脏数据。

3. **WHERE author_id = viewer_id**:  
   The `WHERE` clause filters the rows to only include cases where the `author_id` is equal to the `viewer_id`, meaning the author is viewing their own article.

   `WHERE` 子句筛选出 `author_id` 等于 `viewer_id` 的行，即作者查看自己文章的情况。

4. **ORDER BY [author_id]**:  
   The `ORDER BY` clause ensures that the result set is sorted by `author_id`. This provides an ordered list of authors who viewed their own articles.

   `ORDER BY` 子句确保结果集按 `author_id` 排序。这提供了一个按顺序列出的查看自己文章的作者列表。

### Key Concepts:

- **DISTINCT**:  
   The `DISTINCT` keyword removes duplicate entries. This is crucial in this case because an author could view their own article multiple times. Without `DISTINCT`, the query would return multiple rows for the same `author_id` if they viewed their article more than once.

   **DISTINCT**:  
   `DISTINCT` 关键字删除重复的条目。这在此处至关重要，因为作者可能多次查看自己的文章。如果没有 `DISTINCT`，查询会为同一作者返回多行记录。

- **NOLOCK**:  
   The `WITH (NOLOCK)` hint allows the query to avoid locking the table during reads, improving performance. However, it may lead to reading uncommitted or dirty data, which could cause inconsistent results.

   **NOLOCK**:  
   `WITH (NOLOCK)` 提示允许查询在读取时不锁定表，从而提高性能。然而，它可能导致读取未提交或脏数据，可能导致结果不一致。

- **ORDER BY**:  
   Sorting the result by `author_id` ensures the result is returned in a consistent and meaningful order.

   **ORDER BY**:  
   按 `author_id` 排序确保结果按顺序返回，提供一致且有意义的顺序。

### Warnings:

- **Reading Dirty Data**:  
   When using `WITH (NOLOCK)`, be cautious because it may read uncommitted or dirty data. This is acceptable in environments where performance is prioritized over data accuracy, but be aware of potential inconsistencies.

   **读取脏数据**:  
   使用 `WITH (NOLOCK)` 时要谨慎，因为它可能会读取未提交的脏数据。这在性能优先于数据准确性的环境中是可以接受的，但要注意潜在的不一致性。

### Summary:
This query retrieves a list of unique `author_id`s where the authors have viewed their own articles. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures only unique entries are returned, and the result is sorted by `author_id`. The `WITH (NOLOCK)` hint is used to improve performance by avoiding table locks, but be cautious of potential dirty data reads.

**中文总结**:  
该查询检索了唯一的 `author_id` 列表，表示作者查看了自己撰写的文章。`DISTINCT` 确保只返回唯一的条目，结果按 `author_id` 排序。`WITH (NOLOCK)` 提示用于提高性能，避免锁表，但需要注意潜在的脏数据读取问题。

### Tips:

- **Indexing**:  
   Consider creating an index on the `author_id` and `viewer_id` columns to improve query performance, especially if the `Views` table is large.

   **索引**:  
   考虑在 `author_id` 和 `viewer_id` 列上创建索引，以提高查询性能，尤其是在 `Views` 表很大的情况下。

- **When to Avoid NOLOCK**:  
   If you need accurate and consistent data, avoid using `NOLOCK`, especially in environments where data integrity is critical (e.g., financial systems).

   **何时避免使用 NOLOCK**:  
   如果需要准确和一致的数据，避免使用 `NOLOCK`，特别是在数据完整性至关重要的环境中（如金融系统）。
