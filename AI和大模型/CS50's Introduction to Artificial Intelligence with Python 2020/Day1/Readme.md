### Comparison of Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Greedy Best-First Search, and A* Search

#### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS) (深度优先搜索)

**Definition (定义):**
DFS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.
DFS是一种无信息搜索算法，尽可能深入一个分支，然后回溯。

**Characteristics (特性):**
- **Stack-based (基于栈):** Uses a stack to keep track of nodes.
- **Memory Usage (内存使用):** Low, as it only needs to store a single path from the root to a leaf node.
- **Completeness (完备性):** Not guaranteed if the search space is infinite.
- **Optimality (最优性):** Not guaranteed, can get stuck in deep but non-optimal paths.
- **Time Complexity (时间复杂度):** \(O(b^d)\), where \(b\) is the branching factor and \(d\) is the depth of the solution.
- **Space Complexity (空间复杂度):** \(O(bd)\), where \(b\) is the branching factor and \(d\) is the depth of the solution.

**Pros and Cons (优点和缺点):**
- **Pros (优点):** Low memory usage, can be implemented easily with recursion.
- **Cons (缺点):** Can get stuck in deep paths and is not guaranteed to find the shortest path.

#### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) (广度优先搜索)

**Definition (定义):**
BFS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
BFS是一种无信息搜索算法，先探索当前深度的所有节点，然后再移动到下一深度级别的节点。

**Characteristics (特性):**
- **Queue-based (基于队列):** Uses a queue to keep track of nodes.
- **Memory Usage (内存使用):** High, as it needs to store all nodes at the current depth level.
- **Completeness (完备性):** Guaranteed if the search space is finite.
- **Optimality (最优性):** Guaranteed if all edges have the same cost.
- **Time Complexity (时间复杂度):** \(O(b^d)\), where \(b\) is the branching factor and \(d\) is the depth of the solution.
- **Space Complexity (空间复杂度):** \(O(b^d)\), where \(b\) is the branching factor and \(d\) is the depth of the solution.

**Pros and Cons (优点和缺点):**
- **Pros (优点):** Guaranteed to find the shortest path if all edges have the same cost.
- **Cons (缺点):** High memory usage, can be slow for large search spaces.

#### 3. Greedy Best-First Search with Manhattan Distance Heuristic (贪心最佳优先搜索和曼哈顿距离启发式)

**Definition (定义):**
Greedy Best-First Search is an informed search algorithm that expands the most promising node according to a heuristic.
贪心最佳优先搜索是一种有信息搜索算法，根据启发式扩展最有希望的节点。

**Characteristics (特性):**
- **Priority Queue-based (基于优先队列):** Uses a priority queue to select the next node to expand.
- **Heuristic (启发式):** Uses the Manhattan distance as the heuristic.
- **Memory Usage (内存使用):** Depends on the implementation and search space.
- **Completeness (完备性):** Not guaranteed.
- **Optimality (最优性):** Not guaranteed, it can find a non-optimal path.
- **Time Complexity (时间复杂度):** \(O(b^m)\), where \(b\) is the branching factor and \(m\) is the maximum depth of the search space.
- **Space Complexity (空间复杂度):** \(O(b^m)\), where \(b\) is the branching factor and \(m\) is the maximum depth of the search space.

**Pros and Cons (优点和缺点):**
- **Pros (优点):** Can be faster than BFS and DFS, especially with a good heuristic.
- **Cons (缺点):** Not guaranteed to find the shortest path, can get stuck in local minima.

#### 4. A* Search with Manhattan Distance Heuristic (A*搜索和曼哈顿距离启发式)

**Definition (定义):**
A* Search is an informed search algorithm that uses both the cost to reach the current node and a heuristic to estimate the cost to reach the goal.
A*搜索是一种有信息搜索算法，使用到达当前节点的成本和估计到达目标的成本的启发式。

**Characteristics (特性):**
- **Priority Queue-based (基于优先队列):** Uses a priority queue to select the next node to expand.
- **Heuristic (启发式):** Uses the Manhattan distance as the heuristic.
- **Memory Usage (内存使用):** High, as it needs to store all generated nodes.
- **Completeness (完备性):** Guaranteed if the heuristic is admissible.
- **Optimality (最优性):** Guaranteed if the heuristic is admissible and consistent.
- **Time Complexity (时间复杂度):** \(O(b^d)\), where \(b\) is the branching factor and \(d\) is the depth of the solution.
- **Space Complexity (空间复杂度):** \(O(b^d)\), where \(b\) is the branching factor and \(d\) is the depth of the solution.

**Pros and Cons (优点和缺点):**
- **Pros (优点):** Guaranteed to find the shortest path if the heuristic is admissible and consistent.
- **Cons (缺点):** High memory usage, can be slow for large search spaces.
