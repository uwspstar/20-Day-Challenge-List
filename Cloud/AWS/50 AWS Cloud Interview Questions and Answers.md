      - **Amazon EBS**: Block storage for use with EC2 instances.
      - **Amazon EFS**: Network file storage for use with EC2 instances.
      - **AWS Storage Gateway**: Hybrid cloud storage that connects on-premises environments to AWS.

12. **Q12: How do you create an S3 bucket and upload a file using the AWS CLI?**
    - **A**:
    ```bash
    # Create an S3 bucket
    aws s3 mb s3://my-bucket-name --region us-east-1

    # Upload a file to the S3 bucket
    aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://my-bucket-name/

14. **Q14: What is Amazon EBS, and how does it differ from S3?**
    - **A**: Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) provides persistent block storage for EC2 instances. It is ideal for databases or applications requiring low-latency access to data. S3, on the other hand, is object storage and is suitable for backups, media files, and static content.

15. **Q15: How do you create an EBS volume and attach it to an EC2 instance using AWS CLI?**
    - **A**:
    ```bash
    # Create an EBS volume
    aws ec2 create-volume \
      --availability-zone us-east-1a \
      --size 10 \
      --volume-type gp2

    # Attach the volume to an EC2 instance
    aws ec2 attach-volume \
      --volume-id vol-12345678 \
      --instance-id i-1234567890abcdef0 \
      --device /dev/sdf
    ```

16. **Q16: What is Amazon EFS, and what are its primary use cases?**

    - **A**: AWS Storage Gateway connects on-premises environments to AWS cloud storage. Its types include:
      - **File Gateway**: Provides NFS and SMB access to S3.
      - **Volume Gateway**: Provides iSCSI block storage backed by S3.
      - **Tape Gateway**: Provides VTL (Virtual Tape Library) to S3 and Glacier for backup and archival.

18. **Q18: How do you set up cross-region replication in Amazon S3?**
    - **A**: Enable versioning on the source and destination buckets, configure the replication rules in the S3 bucket settings, and specify the destination bucket in another region. Ensure IAM permissions allow replication.

19. **Q19: What is S3 Lifecycle Management, and how does it work?**
    - **A**: S3 Lifecycle Management helps manage objects in your bucket. You can define rules to transition objects between storage classes (e.g., from Standard to Glacier) or delete them after a specified time period.

20. **Q20: How do you secure data in Amazon S3?**
    - **A**: Secure data in S3 by:
      - Enabling **bucket policies** and **IAM policies** to control access.
      - Using **S3 bucket ACLs** for granular permissions.
      - Enabling **encryption** at rest using S3 server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS) and encryption in transit using HTTPS.

### **Networking**

21. **Q21: What is a VPC, and why is it used in AWS?**
    - **A**: A VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a logically isolated network within AWS. It allows you to launch AWS resources in a secure environment, define IP address ranges, subnets

, route tables, and configure gateways for internet and on-premises connectivity.

22. **Q22: How do you create a VPC and a subnet using AWS CLI?**
    - **A**:
    ```bash
    # Create a VPC
    aws ec2 create-vpc --cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16

    # Create a subnet within the VPC
    aws ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id vpc-12345678 --cidr-block 10.0.1.0/24
    ```

23. **Q23: What are Security Groups and NACLs (Network Access Control Lists)?**

    - **A**:
      - **VPC Peering**: Enables direct communication between two VPCs. It is point-to-point and does not support transitive routing.
      - **Transit Gateway**: Acts as a central hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-premises networks, supporting transitive routing.

29. **Q29: How do you enable VPC Flow Logs, and what are their use cases?**
    - **A**: Enable VPC Flow Logs using the CLI or console. Flow logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces. They are used for network monitoring, troubleshooting, and security analysis.
    ```bash
    aws ec2 create-flow-logs \
      --resource-type VPC \
      --resource-id vpc-12345678 \
      --traffic-type ALL \
      --log-group-name MyVPCFlowLogs \

    aws iam attach-user-policy \
      --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess \
      --user-name myUser
    ```

33. **Q33: What are IAM roles, and how do they differ from users?**
    - **A**: IAM roles are used to grant permissions to AWS services or other users without using long-term credentials. Unlike IAM users, roles are assumed temporarily and are useful for cross-account access or granting permissions to applications running on EC2.

34. **Q34: How do you enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for an IAM user?**
    - **A**: Configure MFA in the IAM Console by selecting the user, clicking "Security credentials", and enabling MFA. Use a virtual MFA device (e.g., Google Authenticator) or a hardware device.

35. **Q35: What is AWS KMS, and what are its use cases?**
    - **A**: AWS KMS (Key Management Service) is a managed service for creating and controlling encryption keys. Use it for encrypting data at rest in S3, EBS, or RDS, and for managing keys used by AWS services and custom applications.

36. **Q36: What are security best practices in AWS IAM?**
    - **A**:
      - Use **IAM roles** instead of users for applications.
      - Enable **MFA** for privileged users.
      - Use **least privilege access** by granting only necessary permissions.
      - Regularly rotate **IAM user credentials** and access keys.

37. **Q37: What is the AWS Shared Responsibility Model?**
    - **A**: The AWS Shared Responsibility Model defines the security responsibilities between AWS and the customer:
      - **AWS**: Responsible for security "of" the cloud, including infrastructure, hardware, and managed services.
      - **Customer**: Responsible for security "in" the cloud, including IAM management, data encryption, and application security.

38. **Q38: How do you configure AWS Config to track changes in resources?**
    - **A**: AWS Config tracks configuration changes in your AWS resources. Enable AWS Config in the console, specify the resources to monitor, and configure SNS notifications for change tracking.

39. **Q39: What is AWS CloudTrail, and how does it enhance security?**
    - **A**: AWS CloudTrail captures API calls made in your AWS account, providing visibility into user activities, resource changes, and security analysis. It is essential for auditing and compliance.

40. **Q40: How do you set up a CloudTrail trail using AWS CLI?**
    - **A**:
    ```bash
    # Create a CloudTrail trail
    aws cloudtrail create-trail \
