# 50 Azure Cloud Interview Questions and Answers

### **Compute Services**

1. **Q1: What are the different types of compute services available in Azure?**
   - **A**: Azure provides various compute services, including:
     - **Azure Virtual Machines**: IaaS-based VMs for custom configurations.
     - **Azure App Service**: PaaS for web applications and APIs.
     - **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute service for event-driven functions.
     - **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Managed Kubernetes service for container orchestration.

2. **Q2: How do you create and configure an Azure Virtual Machine using Azure CLI?**
   - **A**:
   ```bash
   # Create a resource group
   az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

   # Create a virtual machine
   az vm create \
     --resource-group myResourceGroup \
     --name myVM \
     --image UbuntuLTS \
     --admin-username azureuser \
     --generate-ssh-keys
   ```

3. **Q3: What is Azure App Service, and when would you use it?**
   - **A**: Azure App Service is a fully managed PaaS for building and hosting web applications, RESTful APIs, and mobile backends. It is ideal for applications requiring auto-scaling, load balancing, and integration with Azure services without managing infrastructure.

4. **Q4: What are Azure Availability Sets and Availability Zones?**
   - **A**:
     - **Availability Sets**: Group VMs into separate fault domains and update domains to ensure availability during hardware failures or maintenance.
     - **Availability Zones**: Physical locations within a region, each with independent power, network, and cooling for higher availability and fault tolerance.

5. **Q5: How do you scale Azure App Service applications?**
   - **A**: Azure App Service can be scaled up (vertical scaling) by changing the service plan or scaled out (horizontal scaling) by adding more instances. This can be done manually or through autoscaling rules based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.

6. **Q6: How do you use Azure Functions to process messages from Azure Service Bus?**
   - **A**:
   ```python
   import logging
   import azure.functions as func

   def main(msg: func.ServiceBusMessage):
       logging.info(f"Processing message: {msg.get_body().decode('utf-8')}")
   ```
   - This function automatically processes messages sent to the Azure Service Bus queue or topic using an Azure Functions trigger.

7. **Q7: What is the difference between Azure Functions and Logic Apps?**
   - **A**: 
     - **Azure Functions**: Used for lightweight, event-driven code execution without managing infrastructure. Suitable for small snippets of code.
