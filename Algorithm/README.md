### Coming Soon
 
1. **[Sliding Window Pattern](https://github.com/uwspstar/20-Day-Challenge-List/blob/main/Algorithm/Sliding%20Window%20Pattern.md)**:
   - Used for processing a series of data elements by examining a "window" of the data.
   - Ideal for problems involving finding subsets of elements, like the longest substring with K unique characters.

2. **Subset Pattern**:
   - Focuses on generating all possible combinations of elements from a set.
   - Useful for problems requiring permutations or combinations, similar to breadth-first search (BFS).

3. **Modified Binary Search**:
   - Adjusts the classic binary search algorithm for specific conditions, such as searching in a rotated sorted array.
   - Understanding core binary search principles is essential for this pattern.

4. **Top K Elements**:
   - Used to find the top K elements from a dataset.
   - Employs a heap data structure to efficiently manage and retrieve the K largest elements.

5. **[Binary Tree Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://codebitwave.com/algorithms-101-depth-first-search-and-breadth-first-search/)**:
   - Explores each branch of a binary tree deeply before backtracking.
   - Applied to problems like finding the maximum depth of a binary tree.

6. **Topological Sort**:
   - Arranges elements based on dependencies, especially in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).
   - Useful for scheduling tasks or course prerequisites, ensuring all dependencies are resolved before processing.

7. **[Binary Tree Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://codebitwave.com/algorithms-101-depth-first-search-and-breadth-first-search/)**:
   - Explores nodes level by level, using a queue data structure.
   - Suitable for problems that require processing nodes level-wise, like level-order traversal or reversal.

8. **[Two-Pointer Technique](https://github.com/uwspstar/20-Day-Challenge-List/blob/main/Algorithm/Two-Pointer%20Technique.md)**:
   - Utilizes two pointers to iterate through a sorted array to solve problems efficiently.
   - Example problems include finding pairs or triplets that sum up to a specific target.

9. **[Prefix and Suffixique](https://github.com/uwspstar/20-Day-Challenge-List/blob/main/Algorithm/Two-Pointer%20Technique.md)**:
   - Prefix: A prefix of a sequence is a subsequence that starts from the beginning of the sequence and includes any number of leading elements up to the entire sequence.
   - Suffix: A suffix of a sequence is a subsequence that starts from any position in the sequence and continues to the end of the sequence.
